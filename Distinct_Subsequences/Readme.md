Given two strings `s` and `t`, return _the number of distinct_ **_subsequences_** _of_ `s` _which equals_ `t`.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "rabbbit", t = "rabbit"
Output: 3
Explanation:
As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from s.
rabbbit
rabbbit
rabbbit

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "babgbag", t = "bag"
Output: 5
Explanation:
As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from s.
babgbag
babgbag
babgbag
babgbag
babgbag
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 1000`
- `s` and `t` consist of English letters.
